# Bike-Rental-Java-2019
Second year Software Engineering coursework

This repository contains a two-person project I completed during my undergraduate degree. We were tasked with producing a bike rental system, to a standard where it could actually be released to the public.

The project is completed in Java, and contains all testing files.
